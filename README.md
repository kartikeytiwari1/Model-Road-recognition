Reports have assessed that 90% of the accidents occur due to human error. The existing connectivity of roads in India can become more dynamic, safer and mobile through different branches of Technology itself including the Convolutional neural network which leads us to automated map and extracted analysis on the basis of edge-detection and pruning. Predictive and Inferential data analysis which can be achieved by cross-sectional time study of a randomly sampled population with accurate dataset spreading the analysis to multiple servers which would increase learning of geolocations, accidental-zones, acceleration, speed and behavioural changes due to fatigue. Human errors can be minimised by exact Machine Learning technique which automates the analytical model building and can identify patterns and make decisions along previous computation with minimal human intervention by analysing parameters like steering behaviour, lateral acceleration, paddling behaviour and requests operator to take a break. We have modelled a dataset on console through simulation which alerts warning of any adverse finding so the operator can be signalised before any loss or aberration caused by any unobjective signalling. An extensive computerised or website module which advances in art of identifying pattern and computing more complex task should be in the mutual likeliness of enforcement authorities to make the routes more efficient in predicting potential problems.
